# Nashville-Data-Cleaning
Data cleaning from a Nashville Housing dataset of houses on sale with information like acreage, sale price, 
addresses, etc. Duplicates were removed from the dataset based on the ‘UniqueID’, ‘LegalReference’ and 
‘Address’ data, filling the greatest number of cells possible based on the information available, organizing data 
in a more legible way and deleting irrelevant information.
